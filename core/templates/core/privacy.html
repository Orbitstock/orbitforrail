                        <p>We may use your identity, contact, profile, technical and usage data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which Services and offers may be relevant for you
                            (we call this marketing). You may receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased Services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
                        <p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contact us at any time.</p>
                        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get
                            an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>
                        <h4>4. COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
                        <p>Like most Internet sites, our Website may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your user experience and provide customization and useful features to our Website and Services. You can set your browser to refuse all or
                            some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information
                            about the cookies we use, please see our <a href="{% url 'cookie' %}">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
                        <h4>5. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                        <p>Except as outlined in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will never be sold or disclosed with other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right at all times to disclose any personal data that we have collected when: (a) permitted or required by law; or, (b) trying to protect against, prevent, investigate actual or potential fraud, security issues,
                            technical issues, unauthorized transactions or other violations; or (c) trying to enforce the applicable terms of service or other agreements; or (d) protecting against violations to the rights, property or safety of us, our
                            users or the public as required or permitted by applicable laws; or (e) you have given your consent to do so. Finally, we may transfer personal data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation,
                            partial or total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>
                        <p>We may disclose your personal data to our contractors (who may be located outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")) to process it for us, for the purposes of processing transactions, collecting fees, identifying you, but also
                            for improving your user experience, performing business support functions or other related tasks, based on our instructions and in compliance with the Privacy Policy and any other applicable confidentiality and security requirements.
                            In addition, transfers to our contractors are covered by the service agreements with such contractors.</p>
                        <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
                        <ol class="cookie-privacy__ol-alpha">
                            <li>we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>;
                                </li>
                            <li>where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>;
                                </li>
                            <li>where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further
                                details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</a>. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>6. DATA SECURITY</h4>
                        <p>We adhere to the generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Only our authorized employees, agents and contractors
                            (who have agreed to keep personal data secure and confidential) have access to the personal data on a need to know basis.</p>
                        <p>We store and process data, including personal data, in the EEA and possibly in other countries through third parties that we use to operate and manage the Services. When you access or use our Websites or the Services, or otherwise
                            provide personal data to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized agents, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of personal data in and to
                            the other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this
                            Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We
                            ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
                        <p>You agree and acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of data over the Internet may not be secure. We strive to use acceptable means to protect any personal data you share with
                            us, however we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                        <h4>7. DATA RETENTION</h4>
                        <p>We will retain your personal data only for so long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but only for so long as is reasonably necessary
                            for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations (e.g. taxation purposes), resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
                        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
                            for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>When your personal data is no longer required, we will destroy, delete or convert it into an anonymous form.</p>
                        <h4>8. THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h4>
                        <p>The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy apply to the Website and Services only. If you link to other web sites (including sites that offer or use the Services or are promoted by us) or use the services of other service
                            providers, please review the privacy policies posted at those web sites or by the relevant service providers.</p>
                        <h4>9. AEG LIMITATIONS</h4>
                        <p>We do not allow use of our Services and the Website by anyone younger than 18 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete
                            such information.</p>
                        <h4>10. YOUR RIGTHS</h4>
                        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:</p>
                        <ol class="cookie-privacy__ol-alpha">
                            <li><strong>right to request access</strong> to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it; </li>
                            <li><strong>right to request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of
                                the new data you provide to us; </li>
                            <li><strong>right to request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us
                                to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
                                personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
                                </li>
                            <li><strong>right to object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object
                                to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
                                may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms; </li>
                            <li><strong>right to request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's
                                accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;
                                or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it; </li>
                            <li><strong>right to request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                                format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform an agreement with you; and </li>
                            <li><strong>right to withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
                                If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may
                            refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal
                            data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and
                            keep you updated.</p>
                        <h4>11. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
                        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy unilaterally and without prior notice, but any changes will be posted on the Website. If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide additional notice, such as via
                            email or through the Services. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should stop using our Services, the Website or any other aspect of our business. Your continued use of the Website or our Services
                            constitutes your agreement to all such changes.</p>
                        <p>This version was last updated on 23.10.2018 and historic versions can be obtained by contacting us.</p>
                        <h4>12. CONTACT AND COMPLAINTS</h4>
                        <p>For further information regarding the Privacy Policy and related practices or in case of any suspected infringement of your privacy, please contact us at <a href="#"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dcafa9acacb3aea89cbdafafb9a8afbbbdb0b3aeb9f1b4b3b0b8b5b2bbaff2bfb3b1">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>                            or by post: support@orbit-stockindex.com</p>
                        <p>If you reside in the EEA, we will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by, or processed in connection with our Services. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Estonian Data Protection
                            Inspectorate. We would, however, appreciate the change to deal with your concerns before you approach the Data Protection Inspectorate, so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
